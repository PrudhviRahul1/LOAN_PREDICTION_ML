\# Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning



\## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant financial and personal information.  

The objective is to support better decision-making in loan approval systems by reducing risk and improving recall of critical cases.

\## 🤖 Models Used

\- \*\*Logistic Regression\*\* (baseline model)

\- \*\*Random Forest Classifier\*\* (final model)



---



\## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

\- Accuracy

\- Recall (prioritized due to business importance)



---



\## 🧪 Results



| Model | Accuracy | Recall |

|------|---------|--------|

| Logistic Regression | ~82% | ~66% |

| Random Forest | ~97% | ~96% |



Random Forest significantly outperformed Logistic Regression by capturing non-linear relationships and improving recall.

\## ✅ Final Conclusion

Although Logistic Regression provided a good baseline, Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its superior recall and accuracy.  

This makes it more suitable for real-world loan decision systems where missing important cases can be costly.
